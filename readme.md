# CLI RPG Go

This project seeks to build a mini RPG game in GoLang as a simplified version of an MUD (Multi User Dimension) style game. This game will make use of SQLx for ORM with a Postgres DB for storage of user character data, monster stats, and map details. I anticipate high difficulty as I will be building this without a game engine, every component from building a game map to navigate to monster generation and fighting will be coded from scratch.
